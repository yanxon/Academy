# Numerical Optimization Algorithms with JuliaLang

Here I will attempt to understand numerical optimization algorithms with Julia programming language. The format of the notes will be presented in Jupyter Notebook.

The scripting in Julia is similar to Python programming language while it runs like C/FORTRAN.

## Installation Julia
`https://julialang.org/downloads`

## Textbooks
Algorithms for Optimization by Mykel J. Kochenderfer and Tim A. Wheeler

## Materials
- Homework assignments
- Personal notes

## Original Lecture by
